    "## What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. The following are examples of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age (21, 35, 62, ...)\n",
    "- Gender (male, female)\n",
    "- Income (GBP 20000, GBP 35000, GBP 45000, ...)\n",
    "- House price (GBP 350000, GBP 570000, ...)\n",
    "- Country of birth (China, Russia, Costa Rica, ...)\n",
    "- Eye colour (brown, green, blue, ...)\n",
    "- Vehicle make (Ford, Volkswagen, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "They are called 'variables' because the value they take may vary (and it usually does) in a population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most variables in a data set can be classified into one of two major types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numerical variables** \n",
    "- **Categorical variables**\n",
    "\n",

    "## Numerical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of a numerical variable are numbers. They can be further classified into discrete and continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete numerical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable which values are whole numbers (counts) is called discrete. For example, the number of items bought by a customer in a supermarket is discrete. The customer can buy 1, 25, or 50 items, but not 3.7 items. It is always a round number. The following are examples of discrete variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of active bank accounts of a borrower (1, 4, 7, ...)\n",
    "- Number of pets in the family\n",
    "- Number of children in the family\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous numerical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable that may contain any value within some range is called continuous. For example, the total amount paid by a customer in a supermarket is continuous. The customer can pay, GBP 20.5, GBP 13.10, GBP 83.20 and so on.\n",
    "Other examples of continuous variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- House price (in principle, it can take any value) (GBP 350000, 57000, 1000000, ...)\n",
    "- Time spent surfing a website (3.4 seconds, 5.10 seconds, ...)\n",
    "- Total debt as percentage of total income in the last month (0.2, 0.001, 0, 0.75, ...)\n",

    "### Lending Club\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lending Club** is a peer-to-peer Lending company based in the US. They match people looking to invest money with people looking to borrow money. When investors invest their money through Lending Club, this money is passed onto borrowers, and when borrowers pay their loans back, the capital plus the interest passes on back to the investors. It is a win for everybody as they can get typically lower loan rates and higher investor returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about Lending Club follow this [link](https://www.lendingclub.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lending Club dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. Features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes and state, and collections among others. Collections indicates whether the customer has missed one or more payments and the team is trying to recover their money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables. More detail on this dataset can be found in [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data)\n",
