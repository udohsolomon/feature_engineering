    "## Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data, or Missing values, occur when __no data__ / __no value__ is stored for a certain observation within a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data are a common occurrence both in data science competitions and in data in business settings, and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. Incomplete data is an unavoidable problem in dealing with most data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is data missing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of missing data can be very different and here are just a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A value is missing because it was forgotten or lost or not stored properly\n",
    "- For a certain observation, the value of the variable does not exist\n",
    "- The value can't be known or identified\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine for example that the data comes from a survey, and the data are entered manually into an online form. The data entry could easily forget to complete a field in the form, and therefore, that value for that form would be missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The person being asked may not want to disclose the answer to one of the questions, for example, their income. That would be then a missing value for that person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a certain feature can't be calculated for a specific individual. For example, in the variable 'total debt as percentage of total income' if the person has no income, then the total percentage of 0 does not exist. Therefore it will be a missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with understanding the source of missing data, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which missing fields are introduced in a dataset. Depending on the mechanism, we may choose to process the missing values differently. In addition, by knowing the source of missing data, we may choose to take action to control that source, and decrease the number of missing data looking forward during data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Data Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 mechanisms that lead to missing data, 2 of them involve missing data randomly or almost-randomly, and the third one involves a systematic loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Completely at Random, MCAR:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of being missing is the same for all the observations. \n",
    "When data is MCAR, there is absolutely no relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If values for observations are missing completely at random, then disregarding those cases would not bias the inferences made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing at Random, MAR: \n",
    "\n",
    "MAR occurs when there is a systematic relationship between the propensity of missing values and the observed data. In other words, the probability an observation being missing depends only on available information (other variables in the dataset). For example, if men are more likely to disclose their weight than women, weight is MAR. The weight information will be missing at random for those men and women that decided not to disclose their weight, but as men are more prone to disclose it, there will be more missing values for women than for men.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a situation like the above, if we decide to proceed with the variable with missing values (in this case weight), we might benefit from including gender to control the bias in weight for the missing observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Not at Random, MNAR: \n",
    "\n",
    "Missing of values is not at random (MNAR) if their being missing depends on information not recorded in the dataset. In other words, there is a mechanism or a reason why missing values are introduced in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "MNAR would occur if people failed to fill in a depression survey because of their level of depression. Here, the missing of data is related to the outcome, depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a financial company asks for bank and identity documents from customers in order to prevent identity fraud, typically, fraudsters impersonating someone else will not upload documents, because they don't have them, precisely because they are fraudsters. Therefore, there is a systematic relationship between the missing documents and the target we want to predict: fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the mechanism by which data can be missing is important to decide which methods to use to handle the missing values. I will cover how to handle missing values in detail sections 5 and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Predicting Survival on the Titanic: understanding society behaviour and beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 people on board. Interestingly, by analysing the probability of survival based on few attributes like gender, age, and social status, we can make very accurate predictions on which passengers would survive. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Therefore, we can learn about the society priorities and privileges at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peer to peer lending: Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club is a peer-to-peer Lending company based in the US. They match people looking to invest money with people looking to borrow money. When investors invest their money through Lending Club, this money is passed onto borrowers, and when borrowers pay their loans back, the capital plus the interest passes on back to the investors. It is a win for everybody as they can get typically lower loan rates and higher investor returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about Lending Club follow this [link](https://www.lendingclub.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lending Club dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. Features (aka variables) include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes and state, and collections among others. Collections indicates whether the customer has missed one or more payments and the team is trying to recover their money. The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables. More detail on this dataset can be found in [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data)\n",
